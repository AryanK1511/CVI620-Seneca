It first smooths the image to reduce noise, which helps prevent false edges from appearing. Then, it finds areas of rapid intensity change and refines these edges to make them sharp and well-defined. However, this process requires more computation, making it slower.\n",
        "- **Sobel edge detection**, on the other hand, is faster and simpler. It focuses on calculating how quickly pixel values change in both horizontal and vertical directions. While this method can quickly identify edges, it may not be as precise because it can blend thinner edges together or get confused by noise in the image.\n",
        "- **Laplacian edge detection** highlights regions of rapid intensity change but is more sensitive to noise, which can lead to more false edges. It’s quicker than Canny but may produce less accurate results.\n",
